"""
For loops can iterate over a sequence of numbers using the "range" and "xrange" functions. 
The difference between range and xrange is that the range function returns a new list with 
numbers of that specified range, whereas xrange returns an iterator, which is more efficient.
 (Python 3 uses the range function, which acts like xrange). Note that the range function is zero based.

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # This is the same as count = count + 1


# "break" and "continue" statements
##break is used to exit a for loop or a while loop, 
# whereas continue is used to skip the current block,
##and return to the "for" or "while" statement.

# can we use "else" clause for loops?
"""
unlike languages like C,CPP.. we can use else for loops.
 When the loop condition of "for" or "while" statement fails 
then code part in "else" is executed. If break statement is 
executed inside for loop then the "else" part is skipped.
Note that "else" part is executed even if there is a continue statement.
